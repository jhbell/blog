During my last semester at The University of Texas at Austin, I took the 3D
Game Development Capstone Course with Dr. Paul Toprac. After a semester of
late nights and hours of playtesting, I'm proud to introduce Zen Juice, a
puzzle-adventure game for PC/VR.

The game is currently available for 
[free download on itch.io.](https://flpymonkey.itch.io/zen-juice)

# About the Game

You are a monk seeking to restore peace to a distant island. Before you can
do that, however, you must complete four puzzles to unlock the gate on the
island.

Each puzzle you complete unlocks another portion of the gate. In order to help
you solve the puzzles, you have two abilities. The first ability you control is
telekinesis. Using telekinesis, you can pick up objects, move them around, and
rotate them. The second ability you have is a gluing ability. When you enable
gluing, if you touch an object to the one you are holding, they will stick
together in the orientation that they touched. Once the two objects are glued
together, you can move them around as a single object. When you deactivate
the ability all glued objects will detach from one another.

Using these two abilities, you can glue objects together to form bridges and
reach otherwise unreachable objects. These skills allow you to solve the
puzzles you will face throughout the game.

# My Role

Throughout the development of Zen Juice, my primary role was as a developer and
scrum master for the team. As scrum master, I guided the team throughout our
weekly sprint reviews and planning meetings to ensure that we ended up with a
complete game.

On the development side, I did all of the programming and design for the
waterfall puzzle in the game. Additionally, I was in charge of ensuring that
the game had sound. Outside of the title song, which one of our artists, Gwen,
wrote, I wrote the other theme for the game, mastered the audio, created sound
effects, and implemented all of the audio in the game.

# In Review

Making this game was a really valuable learning experience for me. I learned
about the tools and skills needed to develop a game as well as how to work with
an interdisciplinary team.

I think the most important thing I learned, however, is that the game industry
really isn't for me. I've always enjoyed making small games as a hobby, but
making them for a career just isn't that appealing to me.
